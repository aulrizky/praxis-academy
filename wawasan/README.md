## information technology & software
<p>information technology is all process that happens in computers such as creating, process, storing, retrieving, and exchanging all kinds of electronic data. An information technology system (IT system) is generally an information system, a communications system, or, more specifically speaking, a computer system – including all hardware, software, and peripheral equipment – operated by a limited group of IT users. Software is a collection of instructions that tell the computer how to work. <p>

## the diffrent between the difference computer science and Informatics
<p>the difference between computer science and informatics major, computer science is studying how the computer works ex: processes computation on a computer, Informatic major is studying information processes that work in computer, the information processes are connecting between human and computer. The interaction such as interfaces, organization, technologies, and systems</p>

## Software development & Software engineering
<p>
software development is all process to create software, they are conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components. the software development also maintains all source code. software development is also research that develops the latest technology. And the person who is in charge of work is a software engineer
</p>

## Software development & Software engineering
<p>Agile software development is the ecosystem in building software. the ecosystem is a build method for developing software. The basics of the method is a system with a short period and high adaptability to any situation. the center of agile software development is a collaboration

### The value of agile software development
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan
### the the purpose of agile 
- High-value and working App system
- Iterative, incremental, evolutionary
- Cost control and value-driven development
- High-quality production
- Flexible and risk management
- Collaboration
- Self-organizing and self-managing teams

### The Manifesto for Agile Software Development is based on twelve principles:
1. Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.
3. Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)
4. Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
5. Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
6. A face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
8. Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
11. Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
12. Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective and adjusts accordingly

## SCRUM
<p>SCRUM is a method of software development that uses agile. scrum method refers to a strong collaboration team, incremental product, and progress of the product until done, SCRUM can make more effective product management and work technic

## XP(extreme programming)
<p>XP(extreme programming) is a method for developing software to make more simple development that can make more adaptive and flexible. extreme programming is a software development discipline that organizes people to produce higher-quality software more productively. the cycle of programming coding>>testing>>listening>>Designing. the value of extreme programming  communication, simplicity, feedback, courage, respect</p>
